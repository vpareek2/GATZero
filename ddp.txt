This is an alphazero-related project where I am replacing the resnet with a graph attention network, it is written in full cuda and written to train on 8 GPUs.

Overall Architecture:

Use a distributed computing model with one CPU process managing each GPU.
Implement a parameter server model for synchronizing neural network weights across GPUs.


Self-Play (on all 8 GPUs):

Each GPU runs multiple self-play games in parallel.
Use CUDA streams to overlap computation (MCTS, neural network evaluation) with data transfer.
Keep game states in GPU memory to minimize transfers.


Neural Network (GAT instead of ResNet):

Distribute the network across all 8 GPUs using data parallelism.
Each GPU has a full copy of the model but processes different batches of data.
Use NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communications Library) for efficient weight updates across GPUs.


MCTS:

Run MCTS simulations in parallel on each GPU.
Batch node evaluations for efficient GPU utilization.


Training:

Collect experience from all GPUs into a central replay buffer (on CPU or distributed across GPUs).
Sample training batches and distribute them across GPUs for parallel training.
Use gradient averaging across GPUs for weight updates.



Here's a more detailed breakdown of the implementation:
GPU Operations (on each of the 8 GPUs):

Self-Play:

Run multiple game instances in parallel.
Perform MCTS simulations:

Tree traversal and expansion (can be on GPU for massive parallelism).
Batched node evaluations using the neural network.


Store game states and MCTS data in GPU memory.


Neural Network (GAT):

Forward passes for MCTS node evaluation.
Training:

Forward and backward passes on batches of training data.
Local gradient computation.




Data Augmentation:

Perform on-GPU data augmentation for training examples.


MCTS Batched Operations:

Parallel node value backpropagation.
Batched leaf node expansions.



CPU Operations (one process per GPU):

Game Logic:

Move generation and validation.
Game outcome determination.


Self-Play Coordination:

Manage multiple self-play games.
Collect and store gameplay experiences.


Training Pipeline:

Sample batches from the replay buffer.
Coordinate weight updates across GPUs.


Neural Network Checkpointing:

Periodically save and load model weights.


Performance Monitoring and Logging

Inter-GPU Communication (using NCCL):

Synchronize neural network weights after each training iteration.
Aggregate gradients across GPUs for weight updates.
Share updated replay buffer contents.

Implementation Strategy:

Self-Play (cuda/self_play/self_play.cu):

Implement a GPU kernel to run multiple MCTS simulations in parallel.
Use shared memory for frequently accessed MCTS data.
Batch neural network evaluations for efficiency.


Neural Network (cuda/networks/gat/gat.cu):

Implement the GAT model with CUDA kernels for each layer type.
Use cuBLAS for matrix operations and cuDNN for standard layers.
Implement custom CUDA kernels for GAT-specific operations.


MCTS (cuda/mcts/mcts.cu):

Develop GPU kernels for parallel tree traversal and node expansion.
Implement batched node evaluation and value backpropagation.


Multi-GPU Training (new file, e.g., cuda/training/distributed_training.cu):

Implement data-parallel training using NCCL for gradient aggregation.
Develop efficient experience replay buffer management across GPUs.


Main Coordination (cuda/main.cu):

Initialize multiple CPU processes, each managing one GPU.
Implement the main training loop, coordinating self-play, training, and evaluation.


Utility Functions (new file, e.g., cuda/utils/gpu_utils.cu):

Implement helper functions for GPU memory management, CUDA error checking, etc.



Key Considerations:

Load Balancing: Ensure even distribution of work across all 8 GPUs.
Memory Management: Carefully manage GPU memory, especially for large game trees and replay buffers.
Communication Overhead: Minimize data transfer between CPUs and GPUs, and between GPUs.
Synchronization: Carefully manage synchronization points to maintain algorithmic correctness while maximizing parallelism.
Fault Tolerance: Implement checkpoint-restart capabilities to recover from potential GPU or node failures.

As you go through each file, consider the following:

How does this file need to change to support multi-GPU operations?
Are there any data structures or algorithms that need to be modified for distributed processing?
How can you ensure efficient communication between GPUs in this part of the code?
Are there any potential bottlenecks that could be optimized?
How does this file interact with others, and are those interactions still valid in a distributed context?


I have already written most of the code, I just need your help to review the code and help it align with my end goal. Do not write any code, I will give you what I have already done.




Here are some suggestions for improvement:

Memory Optimization:

Implement gradient accumulation to handle larger batch sizes across multiple GPUs.
Use mixed-precision training (FP16) to reduce memory usage and potentially improve performance.


Enhance Parallelism:

Implement model parallelism for very large GAT models that don't fit on a single GPU.
Use CUDA graphs to optimize recurring computations.


Load Balancing:

Implement dynamic load balancing to ensure even distribution of work across GPUs.


Distributed Optimization:

Consider implementing distributed optimizers like LARS or LAMB for better scaling with large batch sizes.
