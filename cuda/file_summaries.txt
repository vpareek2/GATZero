Before I start with the unit testing, I'd like you to take a look through the files. Kind of like you are a senior software engineer reviewing a new grad's code.

I am going to give you a header file and an implementation file. Look through the files thoroughly, looking for discrepancies, errors, and even ways to optimize the code. Do your best work here, I'd like to enter testing with as few bugs as possible.

Here are the first 2 files.
